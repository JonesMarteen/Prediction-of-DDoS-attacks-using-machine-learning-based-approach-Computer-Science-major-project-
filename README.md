### **<div align="center">A Machine Learning-Based Classification and Prediction Technique for DDoS Attacks</div>**  
  

AIM  
  
  

 We proposed a complete systematic approach to detect DDOS attack using machine learning 
 algorithm.  
  

**Overview of this project**  
  

Distributed network attacks are referred to as Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS)attacks. These attacks take advantage of specific limitations that apply to any 
arrangement asset, such as the framework of the authorized organization's site. In the existing 
research study. It is necessary to work with the latest dataset to identify the current state of 
DDoSattacks. In this presented work, used a machine learning approach to predict DDoS 
attack types. For this purpose, used Random Forest and XGBoost classification algorithms. To 
access the research proposed a complete framework for DDoS attacks prediction. To meet the 
proposed objective, we used UNWS-np-15 dataset and Python was used as a simulator. After 
applying the machine learning models, we generated a confusion matrix for identification of 
the model performance. In the first classification, the results showed that both Precision (PR) 
and Recall (RE) are 88% for the Random Forest algorithm. In the second classification, the 
results showed that both precision (PR) and Recall (RE) are approximately 90% for the XGBoost 
algorithm.
Distributed network attacks are referred to, usually, as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attack. A DDoS attack sends different requests (with IP spoofing) to the target web assets to 
exceed the site's ability to handle various requests, at a given time, and make the site unable 
to operate effectively and efficiently_ even for the legitimate users of the network. Typically, 
the target of various DDoS attacks are web applications and business websites; and the 
attacker may have different goals. We predict (Binning or DoS hulk or DoSslowloris).  
  

**SCOPE OF THE PROJECT**  
  

This project aims to develop a system that utilizes machine learning (ML) for classifying and 
predicting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on a network. DDoS attacks 
overwhelm a system with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
Here's a breakdown of the key elements:
• Machine Learning Techniques: The project will explore supervised learning 
algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or XGBoost. These 
algorithms will be trained on historical network traffic data labelled as normal or 
containing DDoS attacks.
• Data Pre-processing: Network traffic data will be pre-processed to remove noise and 
inconsistencies. This may involve feature engineering, where relevant features are 
extracted from the raw data for the ML model.
• Classification: The trained ML model will classify incoming network traffic as normal 
or under a DDoS attack based on the extracted features.
• Prediction (Optional): Some models might be designed to predict the likelihood or 
imminence of a DDoS attack based on real-time or historical traffic patterns.
Deliverables:
• An ML model capable of accurately classifying DDoS attacks within the network traffic 
data.
• (Optional) A system that predicts potential DDoS attacks based on the trained model.
Benefits:
• Improved network security by proactively identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks.
• Reduced downtime and improved service availability for legitimate users.
• Faster response times to DDoS attacks through real-time or predictive capabilities.
Challenges:
• Availability of large and diverse labelled datasets for training the ML model.
• Continuously evolving DDoS attack techniques requiring the model to adapt and learn.
• Balancing accuracy with computational efficiency for real-time deployment

**EXISTING SYSTEM**  
  

CNN and RNN both are two different
algorithmsthat can be used for different purposes.
For example, CNN isused for feature extraction
and RNN is used for regression intime series data
utilization. Though both CNN and RNN based
model producing accurate results, it is very long
and time consuming process  
  

**PROPOSED SYSTEM**  
  

Among the machine learning techniques, random
forestand XGBoost both are powerful supervised
learning models. Both are applicable and used for
classification problems. The random forest
algorithm is approximately 100 times faster than
other algorithms and best working for
classification problems.  
  

ALGORITHM

After preprocessing dataset, that data will be given
to the machine learning algorithm. Machine

types of DDOSs attack .
